This repository analyzes the correlation between atmospheric conditions and air quality in Rome, focusing specifically on the Villa Ada district. It utilizes a synchronized dataset of daily observations spanning from July 2025 to January 2026, acquired through the Open-Meteo Archive and OpenAQ v3 APIs. The project integrates key meteorological variables such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity with pollutant concentrations including NO2​, O3​, and CO. Beyond data acquisition and cleaning, the ultimate goal is to fit and evaluate a model to analyze the resulting time series data.
