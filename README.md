This repository analyzes the correlation between atmospheric conditions and air quality in Rome, focusing specifically on the Villa Ada district. It utilizes a synchronized dataset of daily observations spanning from July 2025 to January 2026, acquired through the Open-Meteo Archive and OpenAQ v3 APIs. The project integrates key meteorological variables such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity with pollutant concentrations including NO2​, O3​, and CO. Beyond data acquisition and cleaning, the core of the study involved fitting and evaluating a Random Forest Regressor to analyze and forecast the resulting time series. By implementing advanced feature engineering—including time-lags and rolling averages—the model successfully captured the atmospheric inertia of the urban environment, achieving a robust R-squared score of 0.88. This high-precision outcome validates the effectiveness of combining meteorological drivers with historical pollutant context to predict air quality dynamics with exceptional accuracy.
